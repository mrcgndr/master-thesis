After explaining the basic relations between air shower observables and the primary mass and energy of cosmic rays, we present different approaches and results of composition studies with surface detectors. Furthermore, we discuss measurements of the longitudinal development of air showers from non-imaging Cherenkov detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The interpretation of these experimental results in terms of primary mass is highly susceptible to the theoretical uncertainties of hadronic interactions in air showers. We nevertheless attempt to calculate the logarithmic mass from the data using different hadronic interaction models and to study its energy dependence from 1015eV to 1020eV."

For this purpose, recent results from direct and indirect measurements of cosmic rays in the energy range from 10 GeV up to 1 EeV are examined. The energy spectra of individual elements, as obtained by direct observations, are extrapolated to high energies using power laws and compared to all-particle spectra from air shower measurements. A cut-off for each element proportional to its charge Z is assumed. The model describes the knee in the all-particle energy spectrum as a result of subsequent cut-offs for individual elements, starting with the proton component at 4.5 PeV, and the second change of the spectral index around 0.4 EeV as due to the end of stable elements (Z=92). The mass composition, extrapolated from direct measurements to high energies, using the poly-gonato model, is compatible with results from air shower experiments measuring the electromagnetic, muonic, and hadronic components. But it disagrees with the mass composition derived from Xmax measurements using Čerenkov and fluorescence light detectors."

	abstract = "In the last fifteen years radio detection made it back to the list of promising techniques for extensive air showers, firstly, due to the installation and successful operation of digital radio experiments and, secondly, due to the quantitative understanding of the radio emission from atmospheric particle cascades. The radio technique has an energy threshold of about 100PeV, which coincides with the energy at which a transition from the highest-energy galactic sources to the even more energetic extragalactic cosmic rays is assumed. Thus, radio detectors are particularly useful to study the highest-energy galactic particles and ultra-high-energy extragalactic particles of all types. Recent measurements by various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA, LOFAR, Tunka-Rex, and others have shown that radio measurements can compete in precision with other established techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the energy, and the position of the shower maximum, which is one of the best estimators for the composition of the primary cosmic rays. The scientific potential of the radio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors, because this combination of complementary detectors can significantly increase the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This increase in accuracy is crucial for a better separation of different primary particles, like gamma-ray photons, neutrinos, or different types of nuclei, because showers initiated by these particles differ in average depth of the shower maximum and in the ratio between the amplitude of the radio signal and the number of muons. In addition to air-shower measurements, the radio technique can be used to measure particle cascades in dense media, which is a promising technique for detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos. Several pioneering experiments like ARA, ARIANNA, and ANITA are currently searching for the radio emission by neutrino-induced particle cascades in ice. In the next years these two sub-fields of radio detection of cascades in air and in dense media will likely merge, because several future projects aim at the simultaneous detection of both, high-energy cosmic-rays and neutrinos. SKA will search for neutrino and cosmic-ray initiated cascades in the lunar regolith and simultaneously provide unprecedented detail for air-shower measurements. Moreover, detectors with huge exposure like GRAND, SWORD or EVA are being considered to study the highest energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. This review provides an introduction to the physics of radio emission by particle cascades, an overview on the various experiments and their instrumental properties, and a summary of methods for reconstructing the most important air-shower properties from radio measurements. Finally, potential applications of the radio technique in high-energy astroparticle physics are discussed."

	The weakest light flashes that can be detected by the PIN diode need to 
	contain several hundreds of photons. An improvement of the sensitivity by 2

	photodiode, a device with internal gain. At the end of the millennium, the

	previous analyses by almost an order of magnitude. At the
	highest neutrino energies between 194 TeV and 7.8 PeV a
	significant astrophysical muon neutrino flux has been
	measured. While the data is incompatible with a purely
	atmospheric neutrino flux at 5.6 sigma significance, the
	data are well described by an isotropic, unbroken power-law
	flux with a normalization at 100 TeV neutrino energy of
	(0.90 +0.30-0.27) ∙ 10-18 GeV-1 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 and a hard
	spectral index of 2.13 +/- 0.13. The corresponding energy
	spectrum is harder compared to previous IceCube analyses
	with lower energy thresholds which may indicate a break in
	the astrophysical neutrino spectrum of unknown origin. The
	highest energy event observed has a reconstructed muon
	energy of (4.5+/-1.2) PeV which results in a median muon
	neutrino energy of 8.7 PeV based on the best-fit neutrino
	energy spectrum. The probability of this event being of
	atmospheric origin has been estimated to be less than
	0.005\%, strongly suggesting an astrophysical origin of this
	neutrino. The arrival directions of this event and all other
	events with reconstructed muon energies above 200 TeV have
	been analyzed, but no correlation with known gamma-ray
	sources was found. Besides the measurement of the
	astrophysical neutrino flux, the high statistics of
	atmospheric neutrinos enable to constrain the flux of prompt
	atmospheric neutrinos originating from heavy meson decays.
	Since no indications for such a signal was found, the
	corresponding flux needs to be below 1.06 in units of the
	flux normalization of the model in Enberg et al.},
