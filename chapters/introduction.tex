\section{The IceCube Neutrino Observatory}

Since January 2011, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole is measuring neutrinos emanating from various sources. For this purpose a detector instrumented with digital optical modules (\enquote{DOMs}) is installed deep in the antarctic ice. 5160 of these optical sensors are arranged on 86 strings at a height between \SI{1450}{\meter} and \SI{2450}{\meter} below the surface. The central region of this In-Ice Array which has a higher density of DOMs is called \enquote{DeepCore}. Figure \ref{icecube:detector} shows a sketch of the detector arrangement.

Neutrinos are very interesting elementary particles because of their weak interaction cross section and their electrical neutrality. This fact makes it possible for neutrinos to let them point back to their sources which is exploited in the search for astrophysical processes like active galactic nuclei, supernovae, or gamma-ray bursts. Since they are able to reach us without scattering processes, neutrinos can even give information about sources at cosmological distances. Simultaneously, the weak interaction potential is what neutrino detection makes challenging. Therefore, a detector with a large scale active volume is needed. In the case of IceCube, this is \SI{1}{\cubic\kilo\meter} of ice.

At the surface on top of the in-ice detector the cosmic ray air shower array IceTop is installed to detect Cherenkov radiation (see \ref{sec:cherenkov}). IceTop consists of 81 stations approximately arranged in the same grid as the in-ice strings. Each station has two tanks filled up with ice and two standard IceCube DOMs. This arrangement makes it possible for IceTop to detect primary cosmic rays (see \ref{sec:cosmicrays}) in the energy range of \si{\peta\electronvolt} to \si{\exa\electronvolt}. One purpose of IceTop is to provide a veto for downward-going neutrinos in the IceCube detector originating from coincident atmospheric air shower events. \cite{icecube:instrumentation} Since IceCube is investigating astrophysical neutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos are a major background.

\section{Cosmic Rays}\label{sec:cosmicrays}

Charged particles or nuclei that are propagating through the universe and incidentally reach the Earth's atmosphere are called cosmic rays. They were discovered by the Austrian physicist \textsc{Victor Franz Hess} in 1912 when he observed an increasing discharge of electroscopes with increasing height in seven ballon flights. \cite{cosmicrays:hess} Hess initially called this underlying radiation \enquote{durchdringende Strahlung} (\textit{penetrating radiation}).

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption[Cosmic ray energy spectrum]{\textbf{Energy spectrum of cosmic rays measured with multiple air shower experiments. \cite[adapted]{cosmicrays:gaisser}} The three prominent regions known as \enquote{knee}, \enquote{second knee}, and \enquote{ankle} are marked. Multiplication of the spectrum by the factor $E^{2.6}$ leads to a better visibility and shows that the spectral index changes at these features.}
	\label{cosmicrays:spectrum}	
\end{figure}

When it comes to cosmic rays, ascertaining the mass composition is a key measurement for learning about their propagation in universe and about extra-galactic cosmic ray accelerators. Figure~\ref{cosmicrays:spectrum} shows that the energy spectrum of cosmic rays follows a power law:
\begin{align}
\frac{dE}{dN}\propto E^\gamma\,,
\end{align}
introducing a spectral index $\gamma$ which is dependent from the considered energy region.
Due to this interesting features, composition measurements at these \enquote{transition points} are desired in particular.

Due to the shape the spectrum is referred to as \textit{poly gonato} (Greek for \enquote{many knees}). The \enquote{knee} is assumed to be based on different rigidity\footnote{property of a magnetic field to bend a particle's trajectory} dependent cut-off energies for sub-spectra of element groups which sum up to the spectrum we observe. \cite{cosmicrays:hoerandel, cosmicrays:shapiro} At energies beyond \SI{e11}{\giga\electronvolt} a strong suppression is observed. The GZK-effect (named after Kenneth \textsc{Greisen}, Georgiy \textsc{Zatsepin}, and Vadim \textsc{Kuzmin}) is supposed to be the reason. Protons with energies above a threshold of \SI{5e19}{\electronvolt} can interact with photons of the cosmic microwave background in such a way that they produce $\pi^0$ and $\pi^+$ mesons via $\Delta^+$ resonance:
\begin{align}
\gamma_\text{CMB} + p \rightarrow \Delta^+ &\rightarrow p + \pi^0\\
&\rightarrow n + \pi^+\,.
\end{align}
Thus, the protons effectively lose about \SI{20}{\percent} of their energy. Additionally, calculations show that these interactions become quite frequent for proton energies of $E_p\gtrsim\SI{e20}{\electronvolt}$ which results in an effective cutoff of cosmic-ray energies above this region. \cite{cosmicrays:gzk}

\section{Extensive Air Showers}

If a high energetic particle -- a photon or hadron -- incidentally reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with their atoms. A common way to describe the traversed atmospheric matter for an air shower is the \textit{slant depth}
\begin{align}
X(h) = \int_{h}^{\infty}\rho(h')dh'\,
\end{align}
with the height dependent air density $\rho(h)$. Once a high energetic \enquote{primary} particle interacts with an atmospheric atom, it initiates a cascade of secondary particles. Typically, one differentiates between hadronic and electro-magnetic cascades or showers (see figure \ref{airshowers:cascades}). For electro-magnetic showers or sub-showers \textit{Heitler's model} is used as a simple conception. The model is based on two-body splittings of electrons, positrons, and photons by $e^+ e^-$ pair production or bremsstrahlung which occur after a fixed distance $d=\lambda_\text{em}\ln{2}$ by using the medium-specific \textit{radiation length} $\lambda_\text{em}$. In other words: after $n$ splitting processes the shower consists out of $N = 2^n = e^{x/\lambda_\text{em}}$ electrons and photons.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{AirShowerHeitler.pdf}
	\caption[Schematic view of extensive air showers]{\textbf{Schematic view of extensive air showers. \cite{famous:niggemann}} Two possible shower formations are shown. A primary photon initiates a electro-magnetic shower (left) whereas a primary proton initiates a hadronic shower with electro-magnetic sub-showers. The splitting steps are stated as well as the interaction lengths. For the hadronic cascades not all traces are sketched for clarity reasons.}	
	\label{airshowers:cascades}
\end{figure}

The multiplication process holds, until the particle energies are high enough for pair production and bremsstrahlung. Below this energy, which Heitler named as the \textit{critical energy}~$\xi_c^e$, the shower size decreases. Hence, the maximum number of particles $N_\text{max} = 2^{n_c}$ is reached after $n_c$ splitting steps. The energy of a considered primary photon $E_\circ$ is then distributed over all secondary shower particles so that $E_\circ = \xi_c^e N_\text{max} = \xi_c^e 2^{n_c}$. With this information, one can derive the slant depth $X_\text{max}$ at which the shower has the largest size. It is
\begin{align}
	X_\text{max}^\gamma = n_c\lambda_\text{em}\ln{2} = \lambda_\text{em}\ln{\left(\frac{E_\circ}{\xi_c^e}\right)}\,.
	\label{airshowers:eq:xmax}
\end{align}
It should be mentioned that this calculation only holds for pure electro-magnetic showers which is the reason for the superscript $\gamma$ in equation \eqref{airshowers:eq:xmax}. \cite{airshowers:heitlermodel}
Since the maximum depth $X_\text{max}$ is dependent from energy and type of the primary particle it is very important for composition studies of cosmic rays. A detailed discussion on several interaction models and comparisons to simulation is done in \cite{airshowers:heitlermodel}.

\section{Detection of Air Showers via Atmospheric Cherenkov Light}\label{sec:cherenkov}

\subsection{The Cherenkov Effect}

The Cherenkov Effect is named after the Soviet physicist \textsc(Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov) and describes the emission of radiation if a charged particle traverses a medium with a speed exceeding speed of light in that medium. \cite{airshowers:cherenkov} The effect is describable in two ways:
