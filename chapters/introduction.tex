\section{The IceCube Neutrino Observatory}

Since January 2011, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole is measuring neutrinos emanating from various sources. For this purpose a cubic-kilometer detector instrumented with digital optical modules (\enquote{DOMs}) is installed deep in the antarctic ice. 5160 of these optical sensors are arranged on 86 strings at a height between \SI{1450}{\meter} and \SI{2450}{\meter} below the surface. The central region of this In-Ice Array which has a higher density of DOMs is called \enquote{DeepCore}.
